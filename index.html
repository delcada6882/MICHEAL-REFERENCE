                    <h1 class="comment">Well, first things first. I absolutely love that this song has a kinda heavy bassline. Like 
                        I think that would sound sick if Michaels song was distorted slighty like this. Not to mention how romantic it sounds
                        like damn, that's just so sweet. The stark contrast in music in lyrics would make it amazing. The sound of this song
                        is just too bouncy to resist. Plus I love how good ol' Roy spells out L-A-N-A at the end. Like I could just imagine
                        Michael going M-U-R-D-U-R. Makes me happy. Plus the song isn't TOO dependent on the circle of fifths, it's mostly carried
                        by the bass and singer on the track. So if I could get a perfect 60's sounding voice for the actor of Michael then I can be happy.
                        Plus those background singers could sound like a crazy mans voices in the head.

                    <h1 class="comment"> Gotta be honest. I just think the big opening is what I like the most. I also like its guitar a bit better.
                        It's not as bouncy as LANA, but it does have that same nice bassline, and the transition to the chorus is good for structure.
                        Also same thing with the background singers. Like I think background singers is a must for this song.

                    <h1 class="comment">I feel that LANA is still the best reference, but I like how this song starts and how its so sweet and how the 
                        first verse is just him describing his want. Plus I like that gallopy beat you know. Also the key change is absolute gold. Like
                        imagine the key change at the emotional climax of the song. Then there's the violin that keeps moving with the song and keeps it 
                        interesting at all times. I feel like that could be a simple feature to impliment.

                    <h1 class="comment"> Just want this here because I like how it sounds and it could serve as good reference, but only for the same reasons
                        that the last 3 fill. The drums stick out to me the most here. The chord progression is also quite nice. Either way, just like the feel.

                    <h1 class="comment"> Too much like the beatles... but it has a good bass sound. That's the similarity here. All of the basses sound the same
                        except for LANA. But to be fair, LANA sounds the same just a bit more distorted. I literally have this song here just because it serves as 
                        more reference for how guitars and drums are supposed to sound.

                    <h1 class="comment"> Gotta have an Elvis song in here. Something odd, is that the drums sound slightly different. I'll have to download multiple packs and
                        test around. Luckly the bass and guitar sound the same. This one also has a little piano in it. Oddly enough off, I learned this song on the guitar before
                        hearing the original and I realize that what I play on the guitar is different because of all the Latin music influence that my grandfather impliments in 
                        every song he plays. I think I'm going to have some of it, or at least expiriment with it a little.

                    <h1 class="comment"> Too energetic. But I like the sound of that brass. I also love that intro. Its so attention grabbing. All eyes on Elvis, he's going to talk about 
                        drugs now. The drums are good too. I also like how the background singers respond to him, I'll definitely add that. But I'm definitely going to keep Michaels song 
                        slower.

                    <h1 class="comment"> Okay, Here's what I know I want. <br/>1. A big opener<br/>2. Background singers that respond to the singer
                        <br/>3. A distorted bass that outlines the chords <br/>4. A nice smooth voice <br/>5. A good contrast between the sweet music and awful lyrics
                        <br/>6. Kinda basic drums. <br/>7. A nice sounding guitar  <br/>8. Reverb that matches the sound of the 50's to 60's <br/>9. A voice melody that goes high and low kinda fast to sound more crazy
                        <br/>10. A song that fades out rather than stopping abruptly <br/>11. A SONG THAT GOES TO MIRROR THE OLD RADIO SOUND OF 60'S SONGS BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY AS NOT TO BE TOO DISTRACTING
                        <br/>I think I may have this in the bag.
